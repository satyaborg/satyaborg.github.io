# satyaborg.github.io

Personal blog.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
```
https://github.com/satyaborg/satyaborg.github.io.git
```
2. Install bundler
```
$ gem install bundler
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
$ bundle install
```
4. Serve the site:
```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To deploy on github pages, simply push the changes by doing a `git push` (after all the other requisite `git` commands).

Hack away as needed.

Fin.
