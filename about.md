Hello.

I am passionate about programming, building things and always up for exchanging ideas and indulging in a few thought bubbles. Artificial intelligence fascinates me: the unexplored recesses of human ingenuity, the augmentation of our collective intelligence, a universal problem solver in some sense and its implications (ethical or otherwise). The road is long and winding, but I hope it will provide a window into understanding our own cognition along the way.

To that end, I work with machine/deep learning paradigms and am [currently a Research Fellow](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/satya-borgohain) at Monash University. In terms of research, I work in the areas of Natural Language Processing, Interpretable/Explainable AI,  Sparsity, Bayesian Neural Networks among others. I studied Mechanical Engineering and subsequently Data Science for my Bachelors and Masters respectively. In my prior life, I built and shipped predictive models to production.

I love hiking, cycling and exploring nature in general and constantly strive to create more room for it in my life. If I'm not out doing those—you might find me <a href='https://satyaborg.com/books'>reading</a>, playing the guitar, listening to a plethora of podcasts or <a href='https://satyaborg.com/art'>sketching</a>.

If you would like to chat or collaborate please feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:satya.borg@gmail.com) or connect with me on my socials below.
