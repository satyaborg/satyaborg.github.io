| Date Read   | Title                                                         |   Published      | Author          |    Thoughts     |
|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------:|:----------------|:----------------|
| 2022/07/08  | The Dark Forest (Remembrance of Earth’s Past, #2)             |             2015 | Liu Cixin       | A (slightly flawed) masterpiece. Better than the prequel and even more profound in scope. The concepts similarly, despite having a fairly scientific grounding, are pushed to their creative extremes in unpredictable ways. The entire trilogy is a must-read. Bonus: we get a contender for the Fermi Paradox.                |
| 2021/11/11  | Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #1)                                |             1990 | Dan Simmons     | Brilliantly woven and was ahead of its time. The main (and secondary) cast, intricate world building, and the subtle tonal shifts between the stories of each character was phenomenal. Despite being part-one, the story felt complete—one with a perfectly ambiguous ending.          |
| 2022/06/26  | The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1)       |             2014 | Liu Cixin       | Highly original and does not shy away from grand ideas. May require a calibration in perspective, especially through the first few chapters but rewards for following through. The characters, despite coming off as being a bit cold, never break the suspension of disbelief within the world of Three-body.  |
| 2021/12/04  | The Fall of Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #2)                    |             1995 | Dan Simmons     |  A respectable conclusion to the saga of "space pilgrims".            |
| 2021/12/30  | Project Hail Mary                                             |             2021 | Andy Weir       | Although a hard sci-fi (win), the protagonist's ordeals vs actions bordered on deus ex machina. Superhuman levels of scientific ingenuity (good for humanity) made for a less believable character, especially in a grounded setting.             |

<!-- **Non-fiction**: Science (mostly astrophysics, computing, AI and neurosci) and nature of mind/consciousness. Unordered ```(finished == recommend)```.
